Detecting Cycles

Challenge Description:

Given a sequence, write a program to detect cycles within it.
Input sample:

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename containing a sequence of numbers (space delimited). The file can have multiple such lines. E.g 

2 0 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 3 1
3 4 8 0 11 9 7 2 5 6 10 1 49 49 49 49
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

Output sample:

Print to stdout the first cycle you find in each sequence. Ensure that there are no trailing empty spaces on each line you print. E.g.

6 3 1
49
1 2 3

Constrains:
The elements of the sequence are integers in range [0, 99]
The length of the sequence is in range [0, 50]
